# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This is a simple project, made to understand the basics of the React library, taking tutorials from articles and YouTube, without following any standardization.

The following libraries were imported to help development:
- ViteJS ( Plugin React )
- TailwindCSS
- UUID
- React Router DOM
- Lucide React
